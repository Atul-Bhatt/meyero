# Meyero

In a conversation, people don't just talk one after another, they talk simultaneously. In regular texting, while you write your reply, sometimes you get a text that renders your reply moot. People try to write at the speed of light to put their point across before the other person can send a text.

With Meyero, you can type while reading what the other person is texting at the same time. The words you type get synced to their screen and there is no send button. Whatever you type, they can see it right away.
